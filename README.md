# UkraineLEDChaser
Designed for addressable LEDs, built using FastLED. Chaser with blue &amp; gold trails. 

Thank you for downloading this code! It can be used with addressable LEDs (also called "Dreamcolor", "RGBIC", or "Neopixels"!), and was tested with a Arduino board. The animation is powered by FastLED. You will need to have the FastLED library installed in order to use.
